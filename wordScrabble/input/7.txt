The Snowman Problem
Kyle and Emma were playing in the snow. It was the kind of snow that was perfect for making snowballs. They talked about building a fort or having a snowball fight.
“How about we make a snowman?” Kyle asked Emma. “Let’s make the biggest snowman ever!”
“Great idea!” Emma said.
The two children started working on their snowman. They each started with a small pile of snow that they rolled into a ball. Next, they rolled their snowballs on the ground, making them bigger and bigger.

  “Do you think my snowball is big enough?” Emma asked.
“Not yet!” Kyle replied. “Keep rolling!”
Emma and Kyle kept rolling their snowballs through the snow. Soon, the snowballs were so heavy that
they could barely push them.
They decided to start making
a smaller snowball to use for
the snowman’s head.
Once the last snowball was ready, it was time to put the snowman together.
“Help me lift this big snowball on top of the other one,” Emma said to Kyle.
The children stood on each side of the huge snowball and tried as hard as they could to lift it. It was way too heavy for them to pick up! They could not even lift it one inch off the ground.

 “Now what?” Emma sighed. “Should we start again and just make a small snowman?”
Kyle and Emma stared at the three balls of snow on the ground. They felt disappointed, but Kyle was determined to build a big
snowman.
“I have an idea,” Kyle replied. “Help me push this snowball.”
Emma and Kyle pushed one of the big snowballs so it was right beside the other one. Next, Kyle rolled the smallest snowball over and added it to the line of snowballs.
“What are you doing?” Emma asked. “Why do you have all the snowballs in a row?”
“I’m making a snowman,” Kyle smiled. “But he’s lying down!”

 Emma laughed. “I know the perfect things to add to our snowman!”
She ran into the house. A few minutes later, she came out with sunglasses, a big, floppy hat, and a glass of lemonade.
“He’s lying on the beach!” she exclaimed, as she carefully put the hat and sunglasses in place on the smallest snowball.
Kyle laughed and asked his sister, “Should we put some sunscreen on him so he doesn’t get sunburned?”
