 The Night Artist
Macy tiptoed through the cabin, as quiet as a mouse. She did not want to wake anyone up. She silently got dressed, picked up her sketch pad and slipped outside.
It was cooler than she expected. And quieter. And darker. It was hard to see even the trees, which just looked like shadows in front of the cabin. Macy crept along the porch to the bench and sat down quietly.

 Everything seemed a bit spooky, and Macy felt a little nervous. She wasn’t used to being outside at night, alone in the dark. Macy thought about going back inside, but she decided not to. Her dad had told her that many wild animals only come out at night, and she wanted to see them. She wanted to see the animals and sketch them.
Macy waited in the quiet of the night. She could hear the wind softly rustling the leaves in the trees. An owl hooted in the distance. After a while, she could see better. Up in the sky, the full Moon
shone down on her, and she could see thousands of stars. The owl hooted again. Macy liked the owl sound, and she started to relax more. She started to sketch the Moon.
After a little while, Macy heard a rustling in the bushes. She could feel the excitement rising in her, as well as a little fear. She reminded herself to be calm and not run if it was a bear.

 It wasn’t a bear. A beautiful doe stepped out of shadows and into the light of the full Moon. The doe was only about 20 feet away. Macy gasped. She had never been this close to a wild animal before.
“You’re so beautiful,” she whispered.
The deer spun its head around and stared at Macy. The deer stood perfectly still. Macy sat perfectly still. The deer stared at Macy. Macy stared at the deer. Finally, the deer decided that
Macy was not dangerous and started to eat the grass.
Macy very carefully and slowly picked up her pad and started to sketch the deer. She drew the deer’s long neck and legs. She drew the spots on the doe’s tan and white fur. She drew the deer’s dark eyes and big ears.

 A couple of times, the deer looked up at Macy. Each time, Macy stopped drawing and sat perfectly still. She did not want to scare the deer away. After a few seconds, the deer always went back to eating grass.
Just as Macy was finishing her sketch, the doe silently slipped away into the bushes.
Macy picked up her pad and went back inside the cabin. Everyone else was still sleeping. Macy knew she should go to sleep, but she was too excited. She looked at her sketch. She felt very special. She had truly connected with nature.
