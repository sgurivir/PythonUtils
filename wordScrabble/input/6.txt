Fishing for Memories
On a warm summer day, Joan was going fishing with her grandmother. They climbed into a small boat and rowed out onto the water. Joan studied the waves all around her, looking for a giant fish to catch.
“You have to be patient when you go fishing,” Joan’s grandmother cautioned. “Can you be patient, Joan?”
“I’m going to catch all the fish in this pond,” responded Joan confidently. “There won’t be a single one left, Grandma.”
Joan’s grandmother smiled, shook her head and handed Joan a fishing rod. Joan quickly cast her line into the water.

 “There’s no bait on your line,” her grandmother said. “Even if there was, you’d still have to wait. Today is about enjoying our time together
and relaxing on the water. You
don’t have to catch everything in the pond.”
Joan scowled, reeled her fishing
line back in and placed a piece of
her turkey sandwich on the hook. Then, she cast her line back into the water.
Joan heard her grandmother chuckle as she leaned over the side of their boat and stared into the pond. She tried to see how far down her sandwich had traveled and whether any fish were nibbling on it. However, the water was too murky, and Joan didn’t feel anything tugging on the end of her fishing line.
After a few minutes, a frustrated Joan sighed in disappointment and leaned back in her grandmother’s boat.

 Her grandmother had been watching Joan. Now, she pointed to the sky and said, “Do you see the bird flying up there? That bird is an osprey,” her grandmother said. “Ospreys catch fish, too.”
Joan watched as the osprey flew in a big circle and then suddenly swooped down to pluck a fish from the water. Joan and her grandmother spoke about how
it would feel to fly like a bird.
Then, they talked about the first time her grandmother flew in an airplane, a long time ago. She was about Joan’s age at that time and
was going to school, just like Joan was
now.
Joan and her grandma spoke
about Joan’s school, and what
Grandma’s school was like.
In some ways, their schools
were different, but in some ways, they were the same. Boys were naughty then, too! Joan and her grandmother laughed at the stories they shared.

 Joan was telling her grandma about something that had happened last week at her school assembly, when her grandmother interrupted her. “Joan, look! Your rod is bending!”
Joan reeled in her line. She had caught a fish, a fish that was hungry for a turkey sandwich.
Later that night, Joan thought about her day, but she didn’t think about the fish or the turkey sandwich.
She thought about the funny stories her grandmother had told her.
