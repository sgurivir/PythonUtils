 “You don’t have to be funny,” said a shark from nearby. “You are kind and helpful. You are friendly and smart.”
“But clowns make people laugh, so a clownfish should make fish laugh,” said Marty.
“The lionfish do not act like lions. The dogfish do not act like dogs,” the shark told him.
“Marty, just be yourself.”
So, Marty did just that. He stopped trying to tell jokes. Soon, the fish all liked him. Soon, he had a lot of fish friends.
One day, Marty said, “I am going to tell you all a joke.”
